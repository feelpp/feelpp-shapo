:description: We simulate the geometric shape optimisation for a rigid object in a Stokes flow.

The examples are based on Lucas Palazzolo's course. For more details, see <<internship_Palazzolo>>.

== Introduction


We consider a rigid object stem:[S] set in motion into an incompressible fluid with viscosity stem:[\mu] at low Reynolds number. The fluid occupies a bounded domain stem:[\Omega] in stem:[\mathbb{R}^N]. We suppose that the boundary is composed of two parts 

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
\partial \Omega = \Gamma_S \cup \Gamma_B,
\end{equation*} 
++++
where stem:[\Gamma_S] is a variable part associated with the boundary of the rigid object and stem:[\Gamma_B] is a fixed part corresponding to the boundary of the domain containing the fluid. Normally, we would consider an edge at an infinite distance from the object. However, in finite elements we are limited for this kind of hypothesis. It is impossible to consider an infinite wall, and the further away the edge of the domain containing the fluid is, the more elements are needed to mesh it, which has a huge impact on calculation time, particularly in 3D.  We will therefore study shape optimisation in a context that is slightly different from <<moreau_shapes_2022>>. The Stokes problem is illustrated in the following figure.

.Illustration of the stokes problem. The stem:[\Gamma_B] boundaries is fixed. The stem:[\Gamma_S] boundary is movable in order to optimize the shape.

Taking the same conditions as in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>, we consider the folling PDE.

.Rigid object in Stokes flow PDE
[.prob#stokes:edp]
****
Let a linear background flow stem:[U^{\infty}] and stem:[U] the translational velocities of the object.  The fluid velocity field stem:[u : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N] and the pressure field stem:[p : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}] is the solution of the Stokes equations
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
-\mu \Delta u + \nabla p = 0  &\qquad \text{in } \Omega,\\
\nabla \cdot u = 0 &\qquad \text{in } \Omega,\\
u = U &\qquad \text{on } \Gamma_S,\\
u = U^{\infty} &\qquad \text{on } \Gamma_B.
 \end{cases}  
\end{equation}
++++

.Rigid object in Stokes flow cost function
[.prob#stokes:minpb]
****
We wish to solve the following minimisation problem
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\inf_{\Omega \in \Omega_{ad}} \left\{ J_{\alpha}(\Omega) = \int_{\Gamma_S} \sigma(u,p)n\cdot \alpha \right\}
\end{equation}
++++
where stem:[n] is the normal to stem:[\Gamma_S] pointing _outwards with respect to the fluid domain_ (therefore inward w.r.t the object) and stem:[\sigma] is the stress tensor defined as
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma(u,p)=-pI + 2\mu e(u)
\end{equation*}
++++
where stem:[e] is the deformation tensor, given by 
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    e(u)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla u + \nabla u^T\right).
\end{equation*}
++++

We define the set of admissible forms as
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{ad}=\left\{\Omega \in C(\Omega_0) \mid \Gamma_B \subset \partial \Omega, ~ g(\Omega)=0\right\}
\end{equation}
++++
where stem:[g] is defined as in <<eq:Omegad>>.
****

By taking precise values for stem:[U], stem:[\alpha] and stem:[U^{\infty}], one can express the cost function as an input to the large strength tensor explained in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>. This brings us back to a problem of resistance: what is the optimal shape to have the least possible resistance on the fluid. They correspond with the projection of the hydrodynamic drag force and torque - exerted by the moving particle to the fluid - along one of the basis vectors.

.Cost function stem:[J_{\alpha}] associated with the entries of the grand resistance tensor (see <<moreau_shapes_2022>>) with respect to the choice of stem:[U], stem:[\alpha] and stem:[U^{\infty}].

== Theoretical formulation of the problem
Let us start by defining the following property which is an important result by integration of parts in the field of fluid mechanics and which will be of great help to us in the future.

.Integration by parts formula for Stokes 
[.prop#stokes:ipp]
****
Let stem:[v] and stem:[\phi] in stem:[H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)], we have 
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    -\int_{\Omega}\left(\Delta v + \nabla(\nabla \cdot v)\right)\cdot \phi =2\int_{\Omega}e(v):e(\phi)-2\int_{\partial \Omega}e(v)n\cdot \phi.
\end{equation*}
++++
****

.Proof
[%collapsible.proof]
====
Let stem:[v] and stem:[\phi] in stem:[H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)].
First of all, by integration by parts we obtain the following relation
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
     -\int_{\Omega}\sum_{j=1}^N\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}+ \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\phi_i = \int_{\Omega}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial x_j}-\int_{\partial \Omega}\sum_{j=1}^N\left(\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\phi_i n_j
\end{equation*}
++++
By summing over the index stem:[i] on the left and right, and using the relation obtain in the end of the proof of <<cantilever:edp>>, we finally have that
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    -\int_{\Omega}\left(\Delta v + \nabla(\nabla \cdot v)\right)\cdot \phi = 2\int_{\Omega}e(v):e(\phi)-\int_{\partial \Omega} 2e(v)n\cdot \phi.
\end{equation*}
++++
====

.Definition : Lagrangian of <<stokes:edp>> and <<stokes:minpb>>
[.def]
****
Since we are working with Dirichlet conditions, we must use the form of the equation <<stokes:edp>> directly for the variational formulation and add to the Lagrangian, Lagrange multipliers associated with Dirichlet constraints. We denote the Lagrangian of this problem by 
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}:\Omega_{ad}\times \left(H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)\right)^4\times \left(L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)\right)^2&\to& \mathbb{R}\\
(\Omega, v,h1,\lambda, \beta, q,h2) &\mapsto & \int_{\Gamma_S}\sigma(v,q)n\cdot \alpha + \int_{\Omega}\left[-\mu \Delta v + \nabla q\right]\cdot h_1 \\
&&  + \int_{\Omega}(\nabla \cdot v) h_2 + \int_{\Gamma_S}\lambda \cdot (v-U)\\&& + \int_{\Gamma_B}\beta \cdot (v-U^{\infty})
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

.Dual PDE of the rigid object in Stokes flow problem
[.prob#stokes:adjpb]
****
The dual PDE of the rigid object in Stokes flow problem is
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}\label{stockes:adjpb}
\begin{cases}
-\mu \Delta u^{*} + \nabla p^{*} = 0  &\qquad \text{in } \Omega,\\
\nabla \cdot u^{*} = 0 &\qquad \text{in } \Omega,\\
u^{*} = \alpha &\qquad \text{on } \Gamma_S,\\
u^{*} = 0 &\qquad \text{on } \Gamma_B,
 \end{cases}  
\end{equation}
++++

.Proof
[%collapsible.proof]
====
Let's start by determining the dual problem. In all the following, for the sake of readability, we will omit the different variables of the Lagrangian. Let's derive stem:[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}] w.r.t stem:[q]. For all stem:[\phi \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)], we have
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    \left\langle  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial q}, \phi\right\rangle = \int_{\Gamma_S} \sigma(0,\phi)n\cdot \alpha + \int_{\Omega}\nabla \phi \cdot h_1.
\end{equation*}
++++
Using a integration by parts formula, then
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial q}, \phi\right\rangle = -\int_{\Gamma_S} \phi (n\cdot \alpha) - \int_{\Omega}\phi\nabla \cdot h_1 + \int_{\partial \Omega}\phi  (n \cdot h_1).
\end{equation*}
++++
Taking stem:[\phi] with compact support in stem:[\Omega], the variables stem:[h_1=u^{*}] and stem:[h_2=p^{*}] and using <<dualderivative>>, we finally have
[stem#stokes:adj2]
++++
\begin{equation}\label{stokes:adj2}
    \nabla\cdot u^{*} = 0 \qquad \text{in } \Omega.
\end{equation}
++++

Let's derive stem:[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}] w.r.t stem:[v]. For all stem:[\phi \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)], then
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
    \left\langle \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial v},\phi \right\rangle =  \int_{\Gamma_S}\sigma(\phi,0)n\cdot \alpha  +\int_{\Omega}-\mu\Delta \phi \cdot h_1 + h_2\nabla \cdot \phi + \int_{\Gamma_S} \lambda \cdot v + \int_{\Gamma_B}\beta \cdot v.
\end{equation}
++++

Using twice integration by parts, we obtain the following formulation
[stem]
++++
\begin{multline*}
  \left\langle \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial v},\phi \right\rangle = -\int_{\Omega}\left[\mu \Delta h_1 + \nabla h_2\right]\cdot \phi + \int_{\partial \Omega}\mu \nabla h_1 n \cdot \phi - \mu \nabla \phi n \cdot h_1 + h_2(n\cdot \phi) \\+ \int_{\Gamma_S}\lambda \cdot v +2\mu e(\phi)n\cdot \alpha + \int_{\Gamma_B}\beta \cdot \phi.
\end{multline*}
++++

Taking stem:[\phi] with compact support in stem:[\Omega], the variables stem:[h_1=u^{*}] and stem:[h_2=-p^{*}] and using <<dualderivative>>, 
even if it means changing the sign of stem:[p^{*}], we finally have that
[stem#stokes:adj1]
++++ 
\begin{equation}\label{stokes:adj1}
    -\mu \Delta u^{*} + \nabla p^{*} = 0 \qquad \text{in } \Omega.
\end{equation}
++++
Let us start from the first equation for stem:[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial v}] and apply the <<stokes:ipp>> twice in order to obtain the following result

[stem]
++++
\begin{multline*}
\left\langle \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial v},\phi \right\rangle = -\int_{\Omega}\mu \left[\Delta h_1 + \nabla(\nabla \cdot h_1) +\nabla h_2\right]\cdot \phi + \int_{\Omega}\mu \nabla(\nabla\cdot \phi)\cdot h_1  + \int_{\partial \Omega}h_2(n\cdot \phi)\\+2\mu\int_{\partial \Omega} e(h_1)n\cdot \phi-e(\phi)n\cdot h_1 + \int_{\Gamma_B}\beta \cdot \phi+\int_{\Gamma_S} \lambda\cdot \phi +2\mu e(\phi)n\cdot \alpha.
\end{multline*}
++++

Let us take the test functions stem:[\phi] with zero divergence such that stem:[\phi] vanishes on stem:[\partial \Omega] and stem:[e(\phi)n] describes stem:[L^2(\Gamma_S)] (respectively stem:[L^2(\Gamma_B)]). By taking the variables stem:[h_1=u^{*}] and stem:[h_2=-p^{*}] solution of <<stokes:adj1>> and <<stokes:adj2>>, and using <<dualderivative>>, we obtain

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
    u^{*}=\alpha \qquad \text{on } \Gamma_S, \label{stokes:adj41}\\
    u^{*}= 0 \qquad \text{on } \Gamma_B \label{stokes:adj42}.
\end{align}
++++

Using the previous equations, we find the result.

By applying the <<stokes:ipp>> twice, we have

[stem]

\begin{multline*}
\left\langle \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial v},\phi \right\rangle = -\int_{\Omega}\mu \left[\Delta h_1 + \nabla(\nabla \cdot h_1) +\nabla h_2\right]\cdot \phi + \int_{\Omega}\mu \nabla(\nabla\cdot \phi)\cdot h_1  + \int_{\partial \Omega}h_2(n\cdot \phi)\\+2\mu\int_{\partial \Omega} e(h_1)n\cdot \phi-e(\phi)n\cdot h_1 + \int_{\Gamma_B}\beta \cdot \phi+\int_{\Gamma_S} \lambda\cdot \phi +2\mu e(\phi)n\cdot \alpha.
\end{multline*}

Let us take the test functions stem:[\phi] with zero divergence such that stem:[e(\phi)n] vanishes on stem:[\partial \Omega] and stem:[\phi] describes stem:[L^2(\Gamma_S)] (respectively stem:[L^2(\Gamma_B)]). By taking the variables stem:[h_1=u^{*}] and stem:[h_2=-p^{*}] solution of <<stokes:adjpb>>, and using <<dualderivative>>, we obtain

\begin{align}
    2\mu e(u^{*})n + p^{*}n + \lambda = 0 \qquad \text{on } \Gamma_S, \label{stokes:adj31}\\

Let stem:[(u^{*},p^{*})] solution to problem <<stokes:adjpb>>, stem:[u] solution to problem <<stokes:edp>> and stem:[f] such as 

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
    f(\Omega)=-\int_{\partial \Omega}\sigma(u^{*},\pm p^{*})n\cdot (u-U),
\end{equation}
++++

then we have

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    Df(\Omega)(\theta)=-2\mu\int_{\Gamma_S}\theta\cdot n \left[e(u^{*}):e(u-U)\right].
\end{equation*}
++++

The relation is also valid by exchanging the role of stem:[(u,p)] and stem:[(u^{*},p^{*})] , and by taking stem:[U=\alpha].
****

.Proof
[%collapsible.proof]
====
To simplify, we will note stem:[a_{\pm}=\sigma(u^{*},\pm p^{*})n]. Using the fact that stem:[\Gamma_S] is fixed and <<Prop:diffJpartialOmega>>, we obtain

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    Df(\Omega)(\theta)=-\int_{\Gamma_S}\theta\cdot n \left[\nabla\left(a_{\pm}\cdot (u-U)\right)\cdot n + (\nabla \cdot n)a_{\pm}\cdot (u-U)\right].
\end{equation*}
++++

Thanks to the boundary conditions, the last term vanishes and we have

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    Df(\Omega)(\theta)=-\int_{\Gamma_S}\theta\cdot n \left[\nabla\left(a_{\pm}\cdot (u-U)\right)\cdot n\right].
\end{equation*}
++++

However, we have that stem:[\nabla \left(a_{\pm}\cdot (u-U)\right)\cdot n = (\nabla a_{\pm})(u-U)\cdot n +\nabla (u-U)a_{\pm} \cdot n]. Thus, injecting this equation into the above integral while neglecting the terms due to the boundary conditions, we obtain 

[stem]
++++
\begin{align*}
    Df(\Omega)(\theta) &=-\int_{\Gamma_S}\theta\cdot n\left[\nabla(u-U)a_{\pm}\cdot n\right]\\
    &=-\int_{\Gamma_S}\left[2\mu e(u^{*})\nabla (u-U)n\cdot n \pm p \nabla(u-U)n\cdot n\right].
\end{align*}
++++


<<Prop:divnul>> allows us to vanish the last term when the first term can be rewritten using <<Prop:astucestokes>>, which gives us

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    Df(\Omega)(\theta)=-2\mu\int_{\Gamma_S}\theta\cdot n\left[ e(u^{*}):e(u-U)\right].
\end{equation*}
++++

The reasoning is exactly the same when we exchange the roles of stem:[(u,p)] and stem:[(u^{*},p^{*})], and by taking stem:[U=\alpha].

Of particular note, if we assume the that stem:[U] and stem:[\alpha] are taking in table of entries of grand resistance tensor, then

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
    G(\Omega)=-2\mu e(u^{*}):e(u).
\end{equation}
++++
****


.Proof
[%collapsible.proof]
====
We apply the Cea's method assuming all the necessary regularities. We thus obtain 

[stem#stokes:Lreform]
++++
\begin{multline}
    \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}(\Omega,v,h_1,\lambda,\beta,q,h_2)=\int_{\Gamma_S}\sigma(v,q)n\cdot \alpha + \int_{\Omega}\left[-\mu \Delta v + \nabla q\right]\cdot h_1 + \int_{\Omega}(\nabla \cdot v)h_2 \\
    +\int_{\Gamma_S}\lambda \cdot (v-U) + \int_{\Gamma_B}\beta \cdot (v-U^{\infty}).
\end{multline}
++++

By taking as variables in the derivative of the Lagrangian the solutions of the primal problem stem:[(u,p)] and of the dual problem stem:[(u^{*},p^{*})], the terms stem:[-\Delta u + \nabla p] as well as the divergence of stem:[u] and stem:[u^{*}] vanish. Moreover, since the boundary stem:[\Gamma_B] is fixed, by deriving all the integrals stem:[\Gamma_B] cancel out. Thus, we obtain the following relationship :

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial \Omega}(\Omega,u,u^{*},\lambda^{*},\beta^{*},p,-p^{*})(\theta)= Df(\Omega)(\theta)+Dg(\Omega)(\theta),
\end{equation*}
++++

with

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
f(\Omega)=\int_{\Gamma_S}\sigma(v,q)n\cdot \alpha \quad \text{and}\quad 
        g(\Omega)=\int_{\Gamma_S}\lambda\cdot (v-U).
\end{equation*}
++++

To derive the function stem:[f] and stem:[g], we use Proposition <<Prop:dfsigma>>. Thus, we have

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation*}
   \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\alpha}}{\partial \Omega}(\Omega,u,u^{*},\lambda^{*},\beta^{*},p,-p^{*})(\theta)=2\mu \int_{\Gamma_S} \theta \cdot n \left[e(u):e(\alpha)-e(u^{*}):e(u-U)\right].
\end{equation*}
++++

Finally, we obtain that 

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}\label{stokes:shaped}
    DJ(\Omega)(\theta)=-2\mu \int_{\Gamma_S}\theta \cdot n \left[e(u^{*}):e(u)-e(u):e(\alpha)-e(u^{*}):e(U)\right].
\end{equation}
++++

Hence the results.

== Experimental Evaluation

To align with the findings in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>, we initially consider a sphere as the solid at the center of the fluid domain. The primal and dual problems are solved using stem:[\mathbb{P}_2] continuous finite elements for velocity and stem:[\mathbb{P}_1] continuous finite elements for pressure. The expansion problem solution is also expressed with a stem:[\mathbb{P}_1] continuous finite elements. It is important to keep in mind that our assumptions differ from those in the paper <<moreau_shapes_2022>>. In particular, we assume that the stem:[\Gamma_B] edge is infinitely far from the stem:[\Gamma_S] edge, which is not achievable using finite elements. Consequently, the obtained results may differ. The results obtained for the GD method and the NSGF method will be presented.

=== 2D simulation for stem:[K_{11}] case 

We consider the 2D stem:[K_{11}] resistance problem. The initial fluid domain is a square with a spherical hole at its center. The parameter values chosen are described in the following table and with the following initial domain.

|stem:[L] | stem:[10]

|===


For this specific test case, we employed an initial discretization of stem:[h=0.2] around the spherical surface and stem:[h=1] around the square. The optimization parameters we selected were stem:[l=20], stem:[a=b=0.5], and stem:[c=1e3]. In the NSGF method, remeshing plays a crucial role, particularly in the 2D case. To avoid convergence issues, we fixed the mesh at the edge of the solid, as the deformation was not significant. Consequently, the initial mesh was much more refined, with stem:[h=0.05] at the solid boundary.

The shape obtained in 2D closely resembles a rugby ball, as described in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>. It effectively preserves the initial volume and achieves a lower cost function compared to the initial domain. The results obtained with the two methods exhibit striking similarity.

In the following sections, we investigate the cases stem:[K_{11}], stem:[K_{12}], stem:[Q_{11}], stem:[Q_{12}], and stem:[C_{11}] to compare our results with those presented in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>. For all simulations except the stem:[Q_{12}] case, we use the optimization parameters stem:[t=0.03], stem:[l=20], stem:[a=b=0.5], and stem:[c=1e3]. In the stem:[Q_{12}] case, we employ stem:[t=5e-4], stem:[l=20], stem:[a=b=0.5], and stem:[c=1e5].

We successfully achieve the optimal rugby ball shape while preserving volume and reducing the cost function. The NSGF method seems to be highly sensitive to remeshing, particularly at the ends, resulting in a shape reminiscent of a lemon. As a result, the simulation needs to be terminated before the mesh collapses at the ends.

As depicted in the previous figures, the simulations are terminated before the cost function reaches a local minimum due to mesh collapse. There are minimal differences in the final shape obtained between the two methods. Nevertheless, we manage to achieve a shape that closely resembles the one presented in the reference article, although it should be noted that the problem we are studying differs slightly as the boundary is at a finite distance from the rigid object.

In this case, premature termination of the simulation is less evident, and convergence is observed with good volume retention. The shapes obtained are virtually identical between the two resolution methods. However, a notable observation is that the ends of the object approach the edges of the cube until they collide with them. This phenomenon is not observed when the cube boundaries are assumed to be at infinity, as depicted in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>.

The boundary of the cube plays a significant role in the obtained results. Contrary to the expected dumbbell shape, we observe the ends of the solid flattening, leading to mesh collapse and an abrupt termination of the simulation. Additionally, these ends are positioned too closely to the cube boundary, resembling the observations made in the stem:[Q_{11}] case. The shapes obtained using the two different methods exhibit a notable similarity.

Mesh collapse continues to be evident in this case, mainly due to sharp edges forming in specific regions. However, the dynamics align with the description provided in <<moreau_shapes_2022>>, and volume conservation is satisfactory. Interestingly, we observe the emergence of four blades on the solid, each with varying prominence. It is worth noting that the difference between the two methods is apparent in figure below, where the blades are not necessarily in the same positions.

.The black wireform corresponds to the result obtained using the GD method. The grey surface is the shape obtained using the NSGF method.
